### Gold Ball Juggler Project & Reverse Engineering (Mechanical Engineering Team Projects)

Made device for juggling golf balls through hoops 2.5 meters off the ground

[Golf Ball Juggler Docs](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/MechanicalEngineeringProjects/MechanicalENgineeringProjects%20(2).pdf)

Analyzed a disposable camera and its design decisions

[Reverse Engineering Report](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/MechanicalEngineeringProjects/MechanicalENgineeringProjects%20(1).pdf)

### Misc. Programs

RunnerCatcher: Programmed a game of tag and analyzed it. Section 4- pictures and analysis.

[RunnerCatcher Report](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/RunnerCatcher.pdf)

DungeonGame: Online course exercise. Simple game where you move around and capture vampires.

BSTrecursion: Binary search tree functions for counting leaves, number of larger nodes, single parent nodes, etc

Sudoku Backtracking: Sudoku puzzle solver. Application of the backtracking algorithm

Animal Guessing Game: Program guesses what animal the user is thinking of based on yes/no questions. Binary search tree application. Storage system.

TrainProblem: Similar to the pancake sorting problem. I made algorithms for sorting train cars on different tracks.

Histogram: A simple histogram generator. Made algorithm for sorting data points into the different ranges efficiently.
