### Fluid Mechanics Simulation

For my CPS (Computational Problem Solving) final, my partner and I made an interactive pipe network designer. The user builds the network, inserts parts, and then modifies the parts to change how fluid moves throughout the system. 

Section 2 of the final report has pictures and provides a good overview of what the program does.

### Gold Ball Juggler Project & Reverse Engineering (Mechanical Engineering Team Projects)

The objective of my ME176 (Mechanical Engineering) final was to design a device that could juggle golf balls through a set of hoops about 2.5m above the ground. The documentation follows the engineering design process in detail. Technical drawings and diagrams are included.

I took apart and analyzed the inner-workings of a disposable camera and its design decisions.

### Misc. Java Programs

DungeonGame: HelsinkJavaMOOC exercise. It's a simple game where you move around and capture vampires.

BSTrecursion: Coded methods for binary search tree implementation to count leaves, number of larger nodes, single parent nodes, etc

Sudoku Backtracking: Sudoku puzzle solver. Application of the backtracking algorithm concept

Guessing Game: BST application exercise. User answers yes/no questions, and the program guesses what animal the user is thinking of. If the animal is not in system, the given question used to differentiate it is stored.

TrainProblem: Similar to the pancake sorting problem. I made algorithms for moving train cars between the main track and 2 auxillary tracks to sort them based by number.

Histogram: A simple histogram generator with a graphical output. I made a clever algorithm for sorting data points into the different "bins" using integer division instead of an if/else structure.
