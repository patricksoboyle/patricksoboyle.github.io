[Final Report](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/FluidMechMathematica/blob/master/FludMechMathematica/NegronO'BoyleFinalReport.pdf)

### Gold Ball Juggler Project & Reverse Engineering (Mechanical Engineering Team Projects)

Juggling golf balls in hoops 2.5m off the ground. 

[Golf Ball Juggler Docs](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/MechanicalEngineeringProjects/MechanicalENgineeringProjects%20(2).pdf)

Analyzed a disposable camera and its design decisions. 

[Reverse Engineering Report](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/MechanicalEngineeringProjects/MechanicalENgineeringProjects%20(1).pdf)

### Misc. Programs

RunnerCatcher: Programmed a game of tag and analyzed it. Section 4- pictures and analysis.

[RunnerCatcher Report](https://github.com/patricksoboyle/MiscProjects/blob/master/RunnerCatcher.pdf)

DungeonGame: Online course exercise. Simple game where you move around and capture vampires.

BSTrecursion: Binary search tree functions for counting leaves, number of larger nodes, single parent nodes, etc

Sudoku Backtracking: Sudoku puzzle solver. Application of the backtracking algorithm

Animal Guessing Game: User answers yes/no questions, program guesses what animal the user is thinking of. Binary search tree application

TrainProblem: Similar to the pancake sorting problem. I made algorithms for ordering the train cars

Histogram: A simple histogram generator. Made a clever algorithm for sorting data points into the different "bins" efficiently
