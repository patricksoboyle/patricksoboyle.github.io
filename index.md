### Fluid Mechanics Simulation

For my CPS (Computational Problem Solving) final, my partner and I made an interactive pipe network designer. The user builds the network, inserts parts, and then modifies the parts to change how fluid moves throughout the system. 

Section 2 of the final report has pictures and provides a good overview of what the program does.

### Gold Ball Juggler Project & Reverse Engineering (Mechanical Engineering Team Projects)

My ME176 (Mechanical Engineering) final was to design a device that could juggle golf balls through a set of hoops about 2.5m above the ground. The documentation follows the engineering design process in detail. Technical drawings and diagrams are included.

I took apart and analyzed the inner-workings of a disposable camera and its design decisions.
